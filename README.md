# Automating-Real-Time-Cryptocurrency-Data-Collection

### **Problem Statement:**
Manually tracking crypto market data is inefficient and error-prone. I solved this by building an automated system to fetch, analyze, and visualize key metrics in real-time.

### 📚 **What I Learned:**
1. **API Integration**: Gained a deeper understanding of working with RESTful APIs, specifically using the CoinGecko API to retrieve structured cryptocurrency data.
2. **Data Automation**: Automated the data fetching process to ensure real-time data collection with minimal manual intervention.
3. **Data Analysis**: Improved my skills in **Pandas** for handling and analyzing datasets, and worked on grouping, summarizing, and visualizing the data.
4. **Visualization Techniques**: Used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to present data trends clearly, making it easier to track price movements and market behavior.

📊 By grouping and visualizing price changes, the project enables a deeper understanding of short- and long-term trends in cryptocurrency markets. This is an essential tool for anyone looking to keep track of market movements and make data-driven decisions.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- Python 🐍
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- API integration with CoinGecko
